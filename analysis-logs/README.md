# Instructions

Ensure that you have obtained `analysis-logs/input/access.log`. 

The script `analysis-logs/input.sh` downloads this file with the Kaggle API. In
order to use the Kaggle API, you must have the API token: `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`.

From <https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api>:

> In order to use the Kaggleâ€™s public API, you must first authenticate using an
> API token. Go to the 'Account' tab of your user profile and select 'Create New
> Token'. This will trigger the download of kaggle.json, a file containing your
> API credentials.
